Discover Diagnostic and Prognostic lncRNA Biomarkers in Patients with Colorectal Cancer Using Machine Learning Algorithms.


Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most frequently diagnosed and fatal cancers worldwide. However, the discovery
of molecular biomarkers and therapeutic targets for early detection and effective treatment of CRC remains challenging.
Deregulated lncRNAs (long non-coding RNAs) has been implicated in the development and progression of various cancer
types, and significantly correlates with patient survival. In this study, we used machine learning algorithms to identify lncRNAs
as potential biomarkers for CRC diagnosis and time dependent survival prediction. We demonstrated that machine learning can
play a potential role for investigating CRC mechanisms and discovering predictive biomarkers. We found that Cox proportional
hazards (Coxph) relative risk score model based on the lncRNAs expression including RP11-440D17.3, EIF3J-AS1, TNRC6CAS1,
MIR210HG, AC113189.5, LINC00261, CTB-25B13.12, AC114730.3 and CRC stage parameter was capable of stratifying
patientsâ€™ risk group, and served as a suitable metric for time dependent risk prediction, the Area Under Curve (AUC) stably
converged to about 0.725 after 8 years in the training and testing data. The performance of classification models including
Support Vector Machine (SVM), random forest and neural network based on the above-mentioned lncRNAs are highly sensitive
and specific in distinguishing between tumor and no-tumor samples with significant p-values in both training and testing data
sets.
