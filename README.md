Discover Diagnostic and Prognostic lncRNA Biomarkers in Patients with Colorectal Cancer Using Machine Learning Algorithms.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most frequently diagnosed and fatal cancers worldwide. However, the discovery of molecular biomarkers and therapeutic targets for early detection and effective treatment of CRC remains challenging. Deregulated lncRNAs (long non-coding RNAs) has been implicated in the development and progression of various cancer types, and significantly correlates with patient survival. In this study, we used machine learning algorithms to identify lncRNAs as potential biomarkers for CRC diagnosis and time dependent survival prediction. This study demonstrate that machine learning can play a potential role for investigating CRC mechanisms and discovering predictive biomarkers. We found that Cox ph model based relative risk score was capable of stratifying CRC risk group, and could be served as a suitable metric for time dependent risk prediction, the Area Under Curve (AUC) stably converged to 0.725 after 8 years. The AUC and accuracy in classification models viz Support Vector Machine (SVM), random forest, and neural network are highly approximate to one in both training and testing datasets with p-values much less than the significant level. These models are highly sensitive and specific in distinguishing between normal and CRC samples.
